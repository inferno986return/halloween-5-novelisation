# Chapter 1

## Haddonfield, Halloween 1988

The night draped itself in the eerie shadows of Halloween, the air thick with the unsettling scent of fear. Police cars raced through the dimly lit streets of Haddonfield, their flashing lights casting a disjointed dance of red and blue on the surrounding houses. In one of the speeding vehicles, the truck carrying Jamie and Rachel careened along the road, desperately trying to escape the malevolent force that pursued them.

Rachel's grip on the wheel tightened as the truck swerved dangerously. On top of the truck, the ominous silhouette of Michael Myers lurked, an embodiment of evil. Determined, Rachel slammed on the brakes, sending Myers flying off the truck. In the heated moment, she unleashed her fury.

"Die, you son of a bitch!" Rachel shouted.

With a ruthless acceleration, she slammed into Myers, propelling him through the air. Jamie, sitting in the truck, was a captive witness to the unfolding nightmare.

"Jamie, I want you to stay in the car," Rachel ordered.

The screech of sirens grew louder as the police arrived on the scene. With Myers seemingly incapacitated, Rachel stepped out of the truck, caution etched across her face. Panic tinged her voice.

"Don't touch him, Jamie!"

But the calm in the night was shattered as Jamie, against Rachel's plea, approached the fallen Myers. The masked figure lay motionless, a harbinger of unspeakable dread. Suddenly, Myers' hand released its grip on the knife, adding another layer of tension to the already fraught atmosphere.

"Jamie! Get away!" Meeker shouted.

"Jamie, don't!" Rachel pleaded.

Ignoring the warnings, Jamie let go of Myers' hand and turned away. In that moment of vulnerability, Myers seized the opportunity, reclaiming his weapon and rising to his feet.

"Get down!" Meeker yelled.

A barrage of gunfire erupted as the police officers unleashed a hail of bullets. Myers fell, seemingly defeated, into a nearby mine shaft. However, the relief was short-lived, for he emerged unscathed, crawling out as the police tossed bombs after him. The relentless pursuit continued, and Myers found an unexpected escape routeâ€”a river that carried him away.

The current carried Myers to a secluded hut, where an unsuspecting hermit lived with his noisy companion, Squawky. Inside the humble abode, the hermit tried to silence his avian friend.

"Quiet, Squawky. Be quiet," the hermit murmured.

Unbeknownst to the hermit, Myers approached the hut with an eerie silence, stepping on a branch that caught the hermit's attention. Oblivious to the danger lurking outside, the hermit reassured his bird.

"There's nothing out there, Squawky."

As Myers closed in on the hermit, a sudden struggle ensued. The masked killer attempted to strangle the hermit, but the tables turned, and Myers found himself falling to the ground, his plans disrupted in the eerie stillness of the Halloween night.
