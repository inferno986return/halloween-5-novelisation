# halloween-5-novelisation
An AI-generated (and human-fixed) novelisation of the Halloween V script because an official novelisation doesn't exist. I won't change much as I want it to stay in US English.

The novelisation is generated with the free ChatGPT 3.5 over at https://chat.openai.com/. It takes a few prompts to get the dialogue to be novelised along with the descriptions.

## Sources
I have archived these on Wayback Machine and Archive.is. Sadly, the script at 45LampkinLane.com looks to have been removed ðŸ˜ž:
