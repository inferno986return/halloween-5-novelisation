# halloween-5-novelisation
An AI-generated (and human-fixed) novelisation of the Halloween V script because an official novelisation doesn't exist. I won't change much as I want it to stay in US English.

The novelisation is generated with the free ChatGPT 3.5 over at https://chat.openai.com/. It takes a few prompts to get the dialogue to be novelised along with the descriptions.

## Purchase *Halloween IV*
If you want to support an actual Halloween novelisation author, the prequel *Halloween IV* by Nicholas Grabowsky sets up this story and can be purchased off Amazon directly:
