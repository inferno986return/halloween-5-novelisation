# Chapter 2
## Halloween Eve - One Year Later

### Children's Clinic - Haddonfield, IL

Rain cascaded against the windows of the children's clinic in Haddonfield, painting a melancholic backdrop to the approaching Halloween night. Jamie lay restless in her hospital bed, entangled in a web of machines that monitored her every breath. The room echoed with the rhythmic beeping of medical equipment, and outside, the rain whispered a haunting lullaby.

Amidst the downpour, Jamie's sleep was a tempest of troubled dreams. She relived the horrors of the past Halloween, a night stained by her own hand—a night when she had stabbed her stepmother with scissors. Her subconscious wrestled with the shadows, and she awoke with a silent scream, the weight of her nightmares clinging to her like a ghost.

A compassionate nurse entered the room, seeking to soothe Jamie's distressed state.

"Nurse," Jamie whispered, her voice barely audible over the sound of rain, "it's happening again."

The nurse tried to reassure her. "It's all right, darling. Jamie! Jamie! It's just another one of your nightmares. Look at me, look at me. Do you want me to call your mom?"

Jamie struggled to respond, her hand gesturing weakly. The scene shifted, and the ominous figure of Myers emerged, a tattoo on his wrist a cryptic symbol of the evil that lurked.

"Nurse, it's him," Jamie uttered, her eyes wide with fear.

The nurse rushed to the door. "I'll call the doctor."

As the nurse left, Myers stirred in a remote hermit's hut. Simultaneously, Jamie, in a state of agitation, turned to a chalkboard, etching a dire message: "HE'S COMING FOR ME." Myers, donning his iconic mask, mirrored Jamie's movements as though tethered by an unseen force. The hermit, oblivious to the impending danger, fell victim to Myers' malevolence.

Jamie collapsed onto the bed, feigning a seizure, while the nurse returned to witness the unfolding nightmare.

"Jamie, Jamie!!! Doctor! Get a gurney—somebody!"

Doctors rushed in, their urgency palpable as they attended to Jamie, attempting to restore the breath that seemed elusive. Loomis, the ever-vigilant guardian, protested against invasive measures.

"Jamie, Jamie. Jamie," the doctor repeated, urgency lacing his voice.

"No! No!" Loomis shouted, his concern etched on his face.

The doctor insisted, "What are you doing? This girl is dying. I have to open her trachea, for God's sake."

Loomis, with conviction, stood his ground. "She will stabilize."

The doctor's desperation grew. "She's dying."

"No..." Loomis muttered, his eyes fixed on Jamie.

As Jamie regained composure, Loomis's conviction held firm, adamant that she bore a message beyond the physical realm.

The following morning, Loomis entered Jamie's room, finding Rachel asleep in a chair beside the bed. Jamie playfully toyed with Rachel's hair as the doctor departed.

"Hey there, funny face," Rachel greeted, waking to the sight of Jamie's playful demeanor. Jamie signaled to Rachel about makeup under her eyes.

"What?" Rachel said, realizing. "Thank you." She wiped the makeup away.

Tina, a visitor, burst into the room, infusing a burst of energy. "Hey! Open up!"

"They don't allow Max in here," Rachel explained as she opened the window.

"Get in there, Max," Tina directed as a dog climbed through the window onto Jamie's bed.

"Tina!" Rachel exclaimed.

Tina laughed, saying, "You know what they can do if they can't take a joke."

Whispering, Rachel added, "She doesn't even remember."

Tina questioned, "Is she really better?" receiving a nod from Rachel. Tina then hugged Jamie, saying, "Give me some of this action, baby." Jamie sighed, her lips moving as if to ask, "What do you have for me?"

Tina looked around and noticed a princess costume. "Ah. I wonder what Rachel is hiding behind door #3," she said, starting to sing.

"Ta da!" Rachel held out the princess costume.

"Billy is going to have..." Rachel began.

"Billy is going to freak," Tina finished. "Fun."

Loomis walked in, questioning the commotion. "What is going on here?"

Tina laughed, apologizing, "Gee, sorry." She directed the dog. "Come on, hun." Then, to Jamie, she said, "Bye sweetie, love you."

Rachel took Jamie's hands, promising, "I'll be back in 2 days, okay?" After they hugged, a crash interrupted the moment. Something had been thrown in the window. Tina came back in as Loomis picked up a brick with a note taped to it. "The evil child must die!" it read. Cut to Rachel and Loomis outside.

"How could they?" Rachel questioned, frustration evident. "When are they going to realize that she is not him? She's just a child."

"They know that Michael Myers is her uncle and that she attacked her stepmother," Loomis explained, shedding light on the community's fears. "That's why they fear her, especially on Halloween."

"I never should have let my parents talk me into leaving. I don't know what I was thinking," Rachel lamented.

"You're afraid," Loomis observed.

"I am not," Rachel defended herself.

"You're afraid the whole thing might start to happen again. There's nothing wrong with being afraid," Loomis reassured.

"And I suppose there's nothing wrong with just leaving my little stepsister here alone?" Rachel pondered.

"You can telephone her from the cabin. She'll be properly looked after," Loomis suggested.

Rachel, torn between responsibility and fear, questioned, "Then why do I still feel guilty?" Tina waited for her at the end of the walkway.

(Cut to Tina and Rachel walking)

"I'm worried about Jamie," Rachel confessed.

"So stick around," Tina suggested.

"I already promised my parents," Rachel replied.

"Promises were meant to be broken, babe," Tina teased.

"I don't know," Rachel sighed.

"The Farm's parties always rock. Think about it," Tina urged.

"Okay," Rachel conceded.

(They reached Rachel's house.) "I gotta jet. Bye," Tina said.

"Bye," Rachel replied.

"I'll be back with the outfits," Tina promised.

"See ya, Tina." Max pulled Rachel towards a tree, barking incessantly. "Max! Max, what is it? Come on, Max, come on." Rachel ushered Max inside. As she entered the house, Myers lingered behind a tree, unseen.

Inside, Rachel started undressing, unaware of the ominous presence watching through a window. She then fed Max, still oblivious to the silent menace that observed her every move.

Meanwhile, Jamie, feeling a sense of unease and foreboding, wandered to a wall and began sketching. Her drawings, a manifestation of the unsettling visions that haunted her, portrayed a desperate attempt to communicate the impending danger she felt lurking.

Back outside, Max continued barking, disrupting the quiet night. "Shut up, Max!" Rachel scolded as she entered the shower.

Simultaneously, Loomis observed Jamie's artistic endeavors, his eyes following her every stroke on the chalkboard. In another part of the house, Billy approached Jamie.

"Jamie," he called out.

In response, Jamie signed, "Max."

"Max?" Billy questioned, turning around and accidentally bumping into Loomis. The unexpected collision drew attention to Jamie's silent communication.

Meanwhile, Rachel, still in the shower, heard the phone ring. "All right, hold on a minute," she said as she grabbed a towel. The ringing persisted. "All right, I'm coming," she continued, answering the call as she entered the bedroom. "Hello?"

"Oh, are you all right?" Loomis's concerned voice came through the phone.

"Yeah, I'm fine. I was just in the shower," Rachel replied.

"Is Max all right?" Loomis inquired.

"Max is having fun; he's been barking at a cat all morning," Rachel assured him.

"Go check him," Loomis urged, a sense of urgency in his tone.

"Well, why?" Rachel questioned.

"Go check him. Now!" Loomis insisted.

"All right, all right. Hold on. I have to go downstairs," Rachel said as she put the phone down. She called out to her brother, "Brother!" then made her way downstairs in her towel.

Unbeknownst to Rachel, Myers observed from the shadows, and as she reached the back door, Max was nowhere to be found. Myers made a chilling appearance in the room behind her.

Rachel picked up the phone again, but before she could speak, she saw the open back door and Max's disappearance. Fear gripped her as she dropped the phone. "Ah," she gasped.

"Rachel?" Loomis's voice came through the phone, now filled with concern.

"Dr. Loomis, Max is gone," Rachel confessed, the ominous truth settling in. The air hung heavy with the impending darkness of another Halloween night in Haddonfield.
