# Chapter 2
## Halloween Eve - One Year Later

### Children's Clinic - Haddonfield, IL

(Its a rainy night, Jamie is in bed tossing and turning, with machines hooked up to her. She dreams about last Halloween, when she stabbed her stepmother with scissors. Jamie wakes up trying to scream but not making much noise. A nurse comes in.)

Nurse: It's all right, its all right darling. Jamie! Jamie! Its just another one of your nightmares that's all. Look at me, look at me. Do you want me to call your mom? (Jamie tries to answer, but can't. Her hand moves- cut to Myers- his hand is moving. He has a tattoo of some shape on his wrist. Cut to Jamie who is flipping out..) I'll call the doctor. (nurse leaves, cut to Myers getting up from a bed at the hermits hut. Cut to Jamie who is writing on a chalk board. HE'S COMING FOR ME is what she writes. Myers is putting on his mask, Jamie acts as though she is putting on a mask. Myers comes up behind the hermit and breaks his neck. Jamie falls on the bed, Myers stabs the hermit. Jamie acts as though she is having a seizure, the nurse comes back in.) Jamie, Jamie!!! Doctor! Get a Gerney---somebody! (Doctors come in) Breathe Jamie, Breathe. (They start bringing her down a hallway.)

Dr: Jamie, Jamie. Jamie, (Since Jamie seems not able to breathe on her own, they start to place something in her throat.)

Loomis: No! No!

Dr: What are you doing?

Loomis: Leave her.

Dr: This girl is dying, I have to open her trachea, for Gods sake.

Loomis: She will stabilize.

Dr: She's dying.

Loomis: No...(Jamie becomes calm and can breathe again.) Do you see?

Dr: I see you, stupid, (mumbles) this girls dead....

Loomis: She has something to tell us.

(Its the next morning, Loomis comes into Jamie's room, Rachel is sleeping in the chair beside the bed, and Jamie is playing with her hair. Rachel wakes up to Loomis leaving.)

Rachel: Hey there funny face. (Jamie signals to Rachel that she has makeup under her eyes) What? (realizes what Jamie was telling her.) Thank you. (Wipes it away.)

Girl: Hey! (Banging on window) Hey! Open up! (Rachel opens the window)

Rachel: They don't allow Max in here.

Girl: Get in there Max. (A dog climbs in the window and goes on the bed with Jamie.)

Rachel: Tina!

Tina: You know what they can do if they can't take a joke.

Rachel: (whispering) She doesn't even remember.

Tina: Is she really better? (Rachel nods) Hey! Hey, hey, hey (hugs Jamie) Give me some of this action baby. (Jamie sighs and her lips move as to say "what do you have for me") What? (Jamie looks around) Ah. I wonder what Rachel is hiding behind door #3 (starts singing)

Rachel: Ta da! (holds out a princess costume)

Tina: Billy is going to have....

Rachel: Billy is going to freak

Tina: ...fun

(Loomis walks in)

Loomis: What is going on here? (looks at Max)

Tina: (laughs) Gee, sorry. (To Max) Come on Hun. (To Jamie) Bye sweetie, love you.

Rachel: (Takes Jamie's hands) I'll be back in 2 days, okay? (nods) Mom and Dad send their long. (they hug. And all of the sudden there is a big crash. Something has been thrown in the window. Tina comes back in, as Loomis picks up a brick with a note taped to it. "The evil child must die!" it reads. Cut to Rachel and Loomis outside.)

Rachel: How could they? When are they going to realize that she is not him? She's just a child.

Loomis: They know that Michael Myers is her uncle and that she attacked her stepmother, that's why they fear her, especially on Halloween.

Rachel: I never should have let my parents talk me into leaving. I don't know what I was thinking.

Loomis: You're afraid

Rachel: I am not.

Loomis: You're afraid the whole thing might start to happen again. There's nothing wrong with being afraid.

Rachel: and I suppose there's nothing wrong with just leaving my little stepsister here alone?

Loomis: You can telephone her from the cabin. She'll be properly looked after.

Rachel: Then why do I still feel guilty? (Tina is waiting for her at the end of the walkway.)

(Cut to Tina and Rachel walking)

Rachel: I'm worried about Jamie.

Tina: So stick around.

Rachel: I already promised my parents.

Tina: Promises were meant to be broken babe.

Rachel: I don't know.

Tina: The Farm's parties always rock. Think about it

Rachel: Okay.

Tina: (They reach Rachel's house.) I gotta jet. Bye.

Rachel: Bye.

Tina: I'll be back with the outfits.

Rachel: See ya, Tina. (Max pulls her towards a tree and starts barking his head off.) Max! Max, what is it? Come on Max, come on. (she goes inside, Myers is seen behind the tree. Inside she starts undressing, then feeds Max. Myers is watching through a window. Cut to Jamie who looks worried and dazed. She goes to a wall and starts drawing. Cut to Max barking.) Shut up Max! (she's now in the shower. Cut to Jamie, Loomis is watching her draw a picture of a dog.)

Billy: Jamie

Jamie: (signs) Max

Billy: Max? (she nods, he turns around and bumps into Loomis. Cut to Rachel still in shower.)

Rachel: (phone rings) All right, hold on a minute (keeps ringing) all right, I'm coming (gets out and goes in bedroom. Picks up the phone.) Hello?

Loomis: Oh, are you all right?

Rachel: Yeah, I'm fine. I was just in the shower.

Loomis: Is, is Max all right?

Rachel: Max is having fun, he's been barking at a cat all morning.

Loomis: Go check him.

Rachel: Well, why?

Loomis: Go check him. Now!

Rachel: All right, All right. Hold on. I have to go downstairs. (puts phone down) Brother! (She goes downstairs in her towel. Myers is watching, she sees the back door open and Max is gone. Myers can be seen in the room behind her. She picks up the phone, and drops it) Ah.

Loomis: Rachel?

Rachel: Dr. Loomis, Max is gone. Tr
