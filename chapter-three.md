# Chapter 3

Loomis urgently instructed, "Listen to me, drop the phone, go to the nearest door, get out of the house, quickly now! Go on!"

Rachel, acting on instinct, hung up the phone and sprinted outside. Unbeknownst to her, Myers observed from a window, silently watching her escape. She rushed to a neighbor who happened to be outside. Shortly after, the police and neighbors gathered outside Rachel's house.

"All clear," First Cop declared.

"Nothing above, nothing below," added Second Cop.

Concerned about Max, Rachel anxiously inquired, "Well, what about Max?"

"A doby, right?" First Cop confirmed, to which Max appeared, running down the sidewalk.

Rachel exclaimed, "This is not happening to me! Max! Max, what have you done? I'm so embarrassed."

First Cop reassured her, "That's what we're here for."

"Rescue cats," Second Cop chimed in.

"Find dogs," First Cop added, a touch of humor in their camaraderie. "That's our job."

As Jamie communicated with Rachel over the phone, the two exchanged affectionate words. Rachel said, "Bye sweetie, I love you," and Jamie responded with a kiss noise. "You be a good girl. Bye," Rachel continued.

Loomis, after Rachel hung up, remarked to Billy, "So she was perfectly all right. Come on, Billy, I think Jamie needs to get some rest."

Concerned for Jamie, Billy asked, "Jamie, are you okay?" He attempted to touch her, but she recoiled and slapped him away.

"Come on," Loomis urged, guiding Billy out. Billy left, but Loomis remained, closing the door behind him. He then took out a pen and paper, imploring Jamie, "You sense something, don't you? Tell me. Tell me what you know."

In tears and attempting to speak, Jamie struggled. Loomis pressed, "Here, write, write, write. Write what you know, Jamie, please, please." Yet, Jamie remained silent.

The scene shifted to Rachel blow-drying her hair in the bedroom. As she got ready, Myers' hand ominously appeared, and he silently watched. Rachel, oblivious to the looming danger, put on a sweater, and Myers left the room. Max's persistent barking drew her attention, and she investigated.

"Max!" she called out, running to the end of the hall, glancing out the window to see Max barking. Disturbingly, she heard the sound of breaking glass from a nearby room. Investigating, she found a dark room with a fallen picture of Jamie. Suddenly, Myers emerged from behind the door, holding a pair of scissors.

"NO!" Rachel screamed as Myers attacked her. The brutal scene unfolded, with Jamie tossing and turning in bed. The nurse and the doctor rushed to the scene, discussing the urgency of Jamie's condition.

Cutting to the police station, Loomis engaged in a heated conversation with Sheriff Meeker. Loomis emphasized the threat, reminding Meeker of the past horrors inflicted by Michael Myers.

"She was shaking, her whole body was shaking," Loomis asserted passionately.

Meeker, seemingly dismissive, retorted, "Every time a little girl twitches, I'm supposed to call out the national guard..."

Loomis interrupted, "How many people did he kill last year? Have you forgotten? Your own daughter!"

Their argument intensified, with Loomis grabbing Meeker and confronting him about the true nature of Michael Myers. The tension built as Loomis revealed his scarred hand, sharing the haunting memory of the night he offered something to the evil that possessed Michael.

As a cop entered the scene, informing Meeker of a situation at the cemetery, the focus shifted to Tina arriving at Rachel's house with bags. She rang the doorbell, calling out for Rachel, and then noticed a brick with a threatening note attached to it. Fear and tension escalated outside the house.

Tina and Rachel conversed about the unsettling situation, expressing concern about Jamie and the town's persistent fear of Michael Myers. Their conversation echoed the lingering trauma from the events of the previous Halloween night.

The screenplay continued to build suspense, intertwining the lives of Jamie, Rachel, and the looming threat of Michael Myers.
